# Important classes

- game states are represented by `class State` from [state.hpp](state.hpp)
- player decisions are represented by different `...Decision` classes in [decision.hpp](decision.hpp)
- the resulting actions are represented by different `...Step` classes from [step.hpp](step.hpp)
- most game rules are implemented in [state.cpp](state.cpp)
